# BELVO, The FinTech Conquistador of Latin America.

## Overview and Origin

Belvo

Belvo was incorporated on May 6, 2019.

Belvo's co-founders are Oriol "Uri" Tintore and Pablo Viguera.

After Tintore and Viguera's combined work of over a decade in the fintech sector, Tintore and Viguera sought to "empower the next generation of financial services in Latin America. In order to do so, Viguera, Tintore, and devs at Belvo built a developer-friendly API that connects their apps securely and quickly with data from banks, gig economy platforms like UBER and Rappi, and tax institutions.

The company started seed funding initiatives on May 29, 2020, and commenced Series A funding on June 1, 2021. Up until Jan 1, 2020, the company had gathered approximately $719,000. Most recently, on December 9, 2021, Visa injected a cool $43 million into Belvo. Belvo, HQ'ed in Mexico City (Avenida Presidente Masaryk 61
Polanco V Secc, Miguel Hidalgo, Mexico City, Mexico 11550), does not publically share every bit investor capital they've received. However, according to Pitchbook, Belvo has 21 different investors, principally: KaszeK Ventures, Founders Fund, Y Combinator, Kibo Ventures Partners, FJ Labs, Future Positive, MAYA Capital, Venture Friends, Harsh Sinha, and David VÃ©lez, founder and CEO of Nubank. As of June 1, 2021, they say they have raised $43 million from their Series A funding round (the largest ever Series A funding round for a FinTech program in Latin America), creating an approximate funding total of just short of $100 million dollars.


## Business Activities:

There is a significant lack of infrastructure in Latin America for data to flow smoothly and safely on open source banking transactions, peer-to-peer transactions, transactions from bank-to-bank, bank-to-user, and between traditional financial institutions and FinTech startups. Belvo is solving this problem by providing all listed users above with one safe, secure API platform to perform such transactions. Belvo themselves claims they are "the most far-reaching API platform on the market. Belvo is well aware we are living in a digital age, where accurate data is crucial to the success of it's customers. Thus, not only are they oriented on developing their platform to connect their users, but to allow their users to access +90% of bank accounts in Latin America to "deliver more engaging experiences." Belvo offers data from Mexico, Brazil, and Columbia, but are looking to soon add Chile, Argentina, and Peru.

Quote: "BELVO is helping us automate our processes without the need to with the legacy systems of banks." - Angel Buzany, CTO of Enconta

It seems that Belvo primarily seeks out businesses to assist with payment systems, onboarding processes, accounting & ERP to aggregate data and enrich businesses' models and platforms. However, BELVO also assists individual users with personal finance assistance, from the help of showing easily-digestible information of users' spending habits, from the help of BELVO's intuitive API. However, BELVO seeks to be the middleman predominantly between institution to individual and/or institution to institution, providing customers with comprehensive, exhaustive data of bank accounts, business and individual tax returns, handling fees, statuses, invoices, etc. As for BELVO's market size, BELVO publishes (as of June 1, 2021) they work with over 60 companies across Brazil, Mexico, and Columbia, and had expanded their API to 40 financial institutions, thus allowing the figure of 90% of Latin American bank accounts to be accessed.

BELVO is not necessarily doing anything particularly novel, and BELVO is not taking advantage of any technicalities that other companies can't offer. However, BELVO finds success as they are worth nearly $100m, and have access to the most information in central and south america. This has allowed Belvo to be the apex FinTech company in Central and South America.

BELVO's implementation of tech is through integrating their API with your personal bank account and or your business's platform. Tech includes webhooks, link statuses, API keys, all used in the API integration, via a sandbox approach. At a glance, via BELVO's API, users in banking are able to access accounts, transactions, balances, owners, and income insights. In Fiscal categories, users are able to see invoices, and tax compliance statuses. In gig economies, users can identify accounts, transactions and owners. However, as BELVO is a private company much like their competitors, not much tech is made public information.


## Landscape:

BELVO dips into many intersections of the financial industry. They work in investments, banking, data aggregation/enrichment/modeling, software development, personal finance and DeFi blockchain transactions.

Over the past 5-10 years, the speed increase of all types of transactions across the board has increased staggeringly. The unanimous distrust of banks since the 2008 collapse, combined with the notion that banks are not needed for peer to peer transactions has seen the establishment of the age of decentralized finance. Secure transactions are handled through the cloud via blockchain, enabling users to send money and receive goods and services more quickly than ever before. It is no accident that revenue in Fintech has increased from $5 billion in 2007 to $35 billion in 2018. No longer do users have to wait the next morning for the next copy of WSJ to gain financial insight. People can code bots using machine learning and AI to more accurately make predictions to invest their money.


Some of BELVO's immediate competitors are QuantConnect, Teller API, True Layer, Plaid, Fintoc, Dapi, and Denarii API. These companies are suited for mainly linking intuitive API with users' bank accounts and companies' platforms and apps.  

## Results

BELVO has flipped the Central and South American markets by allowing their users to access +90% of bank accounts in Latin America. The biggest impact however, has been the recent funding injection from VISA, valuing BELVO just short of $100M. This gives BELVO immense potential to reach more than just Central and South America. Latin America historically has shown widespread poverty amongst the 435 million people living in South America and the 182 million people living in Central America. Thus, banks will be able to perform crucial transactions with other institutions, and users will be able to track their subscription service payments to Netflix- all from BELVO's API and platform.

Metrics core to this domain are the quantity of the data BELVO and competitors are able to aggregate, number of employees, quality of investors and number of money invested, and speed of data processing. Although most FinTech in L.A. and C.A. is still in flux and hard to compare with other companies, the fact that BELVO is osting 111 employees, 3 headquarters in Mexico City, Barcelona, and Brazil, has access to 90% of bank accounts in the region, and just under $100 million in funding, this all puts competitors like Yapily (a 90-employee UK company in Series B funding stage that's API works with financial institutions much like BELVO) in a barn burner race to reform the banking industry around the world. Apart from other global corporations, BELVO is dominating the Spanish speaking sector in the Western hemisphere by a landslide. Other global similar companies like QuantConnect (biggest seed was $960K, 4 employees, 5 investors), and TellerAPI (biggest seed was $4m, 6 employees, 3 investors) don't stack up to Belvo in many categories. However, companies like TrueLayer, a 273-employee UK-based open banking platform designed to connect banks, neobanks, and digital wallets was founded in 2016, has just secured a $130m investment in late stage Series- E funding in September 2021. Thus, there is much room (and promise) for BELVO to seriously compete on a global scale as a open banking titan.




## Recommendations

If I were to advise BELVO, I would have to firstly brush up on my spanish! Nevertheless, I would be interested to see cryptocurrency transactions increase in banana republic-type governments in Central and South America to curb state corruption. BELVO could be the platform these transactions occur on. When citizens stop dealing in blood money, and take less of a dependency on goverment in their lives, freedom could become more of a reality than a theory.

 I think it would see even more users use their product, as citizens start to ween off their country's choice of currency. Not only would individuals have more control over their finances, but they would have control over the means their finance operates on, through choice of currency. Users want more freedom, thus BELVO would see an increase of users, despite potential government backlash.

Cryptocurrency, blockchain, ISP cooperation and intervention, potential VPN integration to curb government resistence and IP tracking. 

Well, if you were the jefe of a banana republic and citizens started using other means of payment, you and your cronies would motion to stop these practices at once (unless you want to watch your poppy fields and properties wilt and crumble). That would be very difficult to do if you couldn't pin down where citizens are using the internet and how they pay for goods. EL Salvador just gave all their citizens $200 in Bitcoin, digital wallets, and national treasuries are almost 40% in bitcoin within the past few months. This advisement is not totally out of the question, and is fully possible.
